# GOFAST-GOFURIOUS
Reconstructing a Pentago UFO video in Unity

See blog post and Youtube video for more informtion first:

The GOFAST folder has the Unity Assets you can just paste in, it was made in version 2019.4.16f1.

I used Nicholas Veselov's water shader, which you may need to re-import, great work this is:

The F18 was just taken from sketchup 3d warehouse, probably not scaled correctly but it doesn't matter, you don't see it in the scene anyway.

In the game, if you press '1', the scene will reload, and '2' will remove the lock - this is only useful in the first few seconds of the scene and it allows you to see how fast the UFO would move across the screen without lock on.

The project could be tidied up, there's extra GameObjects for no reason and other random shit I left in from puting it together but it works.
